## R

Learning R programming is best achieved with Robert Kabacoff's R In Action, 2nd Edition.  Garret Grolemund's Hands-On Programming with R is less celebrated but rewards experienced programmers by uncloaking lots of R's strangeness.  Most programmers should be using Rstudio for development especially because it makes learning easier.  Within R, you can do these things (you'll need an internet connection for that first line):

* install.packages("swirl")
* library(swirl)

Going through the swirl tutorial in R provides efficient learning for new and experienced R programmers, especially if you want learning by doing. 

R is for statistics, you've probably heard, and biostatistics.  The edX online learning platform has an excellent series of courses in R programming, statistics, biology and data analysis.  Learn more at edX and at the book for these courses:
