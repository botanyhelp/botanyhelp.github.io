## Java

New programmers cannot do better than Head First Java by Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates for learning java.  The very best (and very difficult) book on Java is The Java Programming Language by Arnold, Gosling and Holmes.  Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java 4th edition provides very efficient learning.  Learning to program in Java is a steep climb that takes years before comfort sets in.

### Herbjava

Wisconsin Herbarium tomcat web database application.  This code, when running, will perform very similarly to the existing perl, python and OTS web servers running here:

Open source code available on github:

This application is **not running anywhere** to my knowledge.  As a standard tomcat servlet application, it is a port of existing production web servers.  The documentation on github has enough deployment details to get it started again using existing database schema.
