Learning objective-c, swift and iOS should be done with the latest books by Matt Neuburg.  The Apple documentation is good, and should be close at hand, but its not close to the quality and efficiency found in the Neuburg books.  Nowadays swift is the place to start and the place to be for all of Apple system programming.  If you already know [C](/software/c.md), then the fastest way to learn is to read these books in this order, for objective-c or swift:

**Objective-C**

* iOS 7 Programming Fundamentals by Matt Neuburg
* Programming iOS 7, 4th Edition by Matt Neuburg

**Swift**

* iOS 9 Programming Fundamentals with Swift by Matt Neuburg (Oreilly has a free sampler of Chapter 1, "The Architecture of Swift", where you can get a feel for the Neuburg way).
* Programming iOS 9 by Matt Neuburg

Because Apple's XCode is central to iOS programming, and because its a rather visual system, the Head First book can help because it shows how your GUI ought to look and what you ought to click/drag/etc.: 

* Head First iPhone and iPad Development, 3rd Edition by Dan Pilone, Tracey Pilone

That 3rd edition is objective-c based and hopefully a 4th edition for swift will be here soon.
