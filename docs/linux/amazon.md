## Amazon

Running linux servers at Amazon is the best option.  Using amazon can only be done by people that have made an investment in the AWS way of administration.  AWS skills and experience take time to acquire and sit on top of existing knowledge about linux, networking and storage.  Losing your only AWS administrator would be a **bad** thing.  Starting with AWS can begin right now and is inexpensive to try.  Start now with several willing administrators that have experience with linux, storage and TCP/IP network administration.  Migrate each of your things (DHCP, NFS, web, database, DNS, applications) to AWS and get them running alongside your existing infrastructure.  After a year or so, your team will see that you can do it all on AWS, that you can lose a team member, that your performance is better, things are cheaper, systems are more understood and better documented.  You'll have what you had before but now you'll have time to do something more (like sleep easy).
