The R programming, statistics and biology courses were presented by \nRafael Irizarry, Professor of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\n.  Super-Earths and Life was presented by \nDimitar Sasselov, Professor of Astronomy, Harvard University\n.  The biostatistics courses are based on this book, available free: \nData Analysis for the Life Sciences, Rafael A Irizarry and Michael I Love\n and also here on github: \ngithub.com/genomicsclass\n.  I completed six of these courses on time and with scores high enough to earn a certificate.  For two classes, ChIP-seq data analysis and DNA methylation data analysis, scores were too low to earn a certificate.  Detailed performance information are shown below for all completed courses.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPH525.4x: Introduction to Bioconductor \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPH525.5x Case Study: RNA-seq data analysis \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPH525.6x Case Study: Variant Discovery and Genotyping \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPH525.7x Case Study: ChIP-seq data analysis \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPH525.8x Case study: DNA methylation data analysis \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPU30x: Super-Earths and Life \npdf\n \npng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadtapes iPhone App\n is available on the Apple App Store: \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deadtapes/id838487529?mt=8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuclides iPhone App\n  Nuclides was constructed using Objective-C in xCode using iOS7 in February 2014.
