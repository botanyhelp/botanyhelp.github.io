The other nine were presented by  Rafael Irizarry, Professor of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health .  These courses cover R programming, statistics and biology.

The online  edX Platform  might be the best online training platform available.  The biostatistics courses are based on this book, available free:  Data Analysis for the Life Sciences, Rafael A Irizarry and Michael I Love  ..and also here on github:  github.com/genomicsclass  I completed 8 of these courses on time and with scores high enough to earn a certificate.  For two classes, ChIP-seq data analysis and DNA methylation data analysis, scores were too low to earn a certificate.
